abstract = {A method is proposed to aid the designer in selecting and ordering the feature observations for the pattern recognition system, without requiring the computation of the probability of misrecognition or the complete knowledge of the probability distribution for the input patterns under consideration. The essential viewpoint is basically that of pre-weighting the feature observations according to their relative importance in describing the input patterns, regardless of the specific decision structure in a recognition system. “Relative importance≓ is defined in the sense of (1) committing less error when the representation of patterns is subject to approximation due to the finite number of feature observations, and (2) carrying more information regarding the discrimination of pattern classes. It is found that, with these defined criteria, an optimal selection and ordering procedure can be obtained by establishing a generalized Karhunen-Lo\`eve coordinate system for the stochastic processes describing the input patterns. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of coordinates to be the generalized K\2-L system are derived and the resulting selection and ordering procedure is given. Computer-simulated experiments in character recognition are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.}
